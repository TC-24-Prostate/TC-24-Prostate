## **1. Introduction to Prostate Health**

The prostate is a walnut-shaped gland located below the bladder and in front of the rectum. Its primary function is to produce fluid that nourishes and protects sperm. However, as men age, the prostate becomes susceptible to various conditions, such as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), prostatitis, and even prostate cancer.

**Key Statistics on Prostate Health:**

-   Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men worldwide.
-   By the age of 60, about 50% of men experience symptoms of BPH.
-   Lifestyle, diet, genetics, and hormonal changes significantly impact prostate health.

Addressing these challenges effectively requires innovative solutions, and TC 24 Prostate is one such promising advancement.
